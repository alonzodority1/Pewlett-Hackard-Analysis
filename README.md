# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We have been given the task of determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. With this data we can look at the number of employees looking at retirement and prepare for succession planning.

## Results - Immenent Retirement & Succession Potential 

###  Large numbers of senior employees looking at retirement
Close to 60k Senior Engineers and Staff looking to retire in the next few years.  These technical and administrative positions will need to be filled by current subordinates.  This will be a opportunity to focus on both talent and pipeline development

### - Very few managers up for retirement 
With only a few managers up for retirment business flow should remain stable as long as those managers remaining can handle the impending turnover of technical and administraive employees.  

## - Mentorship to respond to up coming retirements

### Shortfall of employees to fill in gap of Silver Tsunami
There is dramatic short fall of employees across titles, except managers, to cover the expected resource loss over the next few years.  

### Hiring and Autoamation versus Mentorship
Mentorship will not save the upcoming human resource crisis PH is going to experience. 

## Summary

PH is in the wake of a human resources crisis where the number of their employees expected to retire in the coming years is greatly larger than thier pipeline and it is highly advised that they beginning hiring junior staff across the board to prepare for the upcoming loss of job force.
